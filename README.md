## Building
1. I use a normal build in Android studio. Hit me up if you can't figure out how to build.
2. You will need to download [imagefs_gamenative](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IfPTwHKcGbhrRBFd0JLBVvIdeA9bFocE/view?usp=sharing) and [imagefs_patches_gamenative](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RJb204kybzigEcjHegh7y1T8lcXb_6wG/view?usp=drive_link) for this to work and place them in the `src/main/assets` folder.
