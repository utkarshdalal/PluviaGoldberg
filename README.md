This is a fork of [Pluvia](https://github.com/oxters168/Pluvia), a Steam client for Android.

## How to Use

2. Install the APK on your Android device
3. Login to your Steam account
4. Install your game

## Building
### IF YOU JUST WANT TO USE THE APP, PLEASE SEE THE HOW TO USE SECTION ABOVE. THIS IS ONLY NEEDED IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE FOR DEVELOPMENT.
1. I use a normal build in Android studio. Hit me up if you can't figure out how to build.
2. You will need to download [imagefs_gamenative](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IfPTwHKcGbhrRBFd0JLBVvIdeA9bFocE/view?usp=sharing) and [imagefs_patches_gamenative](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RJb204kybzigEcjHegh7y1T8lcXb_6wG/view?usp=drive_link) for this to work and place them in the `src/main/assets` folder.
These files are available on request for legitimate development purposes. Google Drive has blocked access to them as they are compressed archives. Please write to me on Discord and I can share them with you there.
