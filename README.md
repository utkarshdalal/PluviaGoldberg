## Features

Pluvia is still in active early development, so some features may be lacking or not working correctly.</br>
Pluvia currently provides these features:

- View and download games through the app.
- *Play (DRM free) games using [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator) built into the app.
- Configure the game containers to use different options to improve the performance of each game.
- Steam Cloud integration for your cloud saves, allowing you to resume where you left off. 
- View your friends list. (Note: chat and friend management in the works too)

&ast; Existing issues or limitations that occur with the actual Winlator app will mostly apply here when running a game.
